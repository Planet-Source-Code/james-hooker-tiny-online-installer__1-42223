### Description

*Updated* 07/01/2003

The installer was trying to make a shortcut, even if you didnt provide info for one, also ive changed it to compile into P-Code, making it compile to just over 50kb now ;D

I was in need of an installer similar to the one SmartFTP provided, downloading the install files from a HTTP server, i couldnt find one to match my needs, so i made one, and here it is.. :P

Its extremely simple, only took a few hours to make, thanks to Sean Gallardy for his brilliant http downloading control ;)

Comes complete with demo config file, compiles to just over 50KB, making it small, and easy to distribute over the net.

Please leave your comments, suggestions etc...it would be appriciated
